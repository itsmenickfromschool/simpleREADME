  ## Description
  This is a way to generate README.md files through a command line application. During this process I learned a lot about how to use node js as well as the Inquirer package. I even generated this file with my application! I found it challenging to use javascript without the browser at first, but am realizing this is not as bad as I thought. [Here](https://youtu.be/YTpBK7kSdDQ) is a link to my walkthrough video.

  ## Installation
  To install this on your local machine, clone the repo and run the code in your IDE of choice. You must have node.js and the inquirer package, you can install node with a quick google, make sure to get the LTS version, and to install the inquirer you can use NPM (node package manager). For info on how to do this, the best resource is the NPM website, and the inquirer documentation. 
  ## Usage 
  This is for speeding up the process of typing boilerplate README files so we can do more fun coding instead. You simply run it with the command node index.js in the terminal and follow the prompts, when you are finished with the prompts you see a new markdown file created.

  I understand that the README file should be called README.md, I avoided doing this in order to be able to easily test it more than once and not have it change the readme of my repo, so it just names the markdown files whatever the title of the project is, if using it to make a readme for another file you can just copy the file you create into your own project and change the title to README.md.
